In this work we analyze a sentiment regression problem. Summarizing the general sentiment of a review and combining it to the other categorical features to obtain a realvalued score. Sentiment analysis is a highly effective tool for a
business to not only take a look at the overall brand perception, but also evaluate customer attitudes and emotions towards a specific product line or service. This data-driven approach can
help the business better understand the customers and detect subtle shifts in their opinions in order to meet changing demand.

You can download the jupyter notebook or read the same one in pdf. For an overview analisys of the problem there is also the "scientific paper" version.
