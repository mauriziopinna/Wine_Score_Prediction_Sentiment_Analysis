# Wine_Score_Prediction_Sentinment_Analysis

In this work I analyze a sentiment regression problem. Summarizing the general sentiment of a review and combining it to the other categorical features to obtain a realvalued score. Sentiment analysis is a highly effective tool for a business to not only take a look at the overall brand perception, but also evaluate customer attitudes and emotions towards a specific product line or service. 
This data-driven approach can help the business better understand the customers and detect subtle shifts in their opinions in order to meet changing demand.

It is possible to run the jupyter notebook in a jupyter enviroment, or read the same one in pdf. 
For an overview analisys of the problem there is also the "scientific paper" version.
